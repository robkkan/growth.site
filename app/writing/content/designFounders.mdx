A few weeks ago, I was scrolling through Twitter and came across a tweet by Aaron Epstein, a YC group partner, which said:

> More designers should be founders. They already have so many of the skills needed to be great—strong user empathy, a focus on solving problems, a high bar for quality, and taste. If you're a designer, what's preventing you from making the leap<SerifChar>?</SerifChar>

Before diving into my thoughts, I want to define what designers strive to be. To me, they want to be detail-obsessed and set the standard for product taste and quality. Designers do possess many traits of great founders, notably their ability to deeply understand users. However, these traits are not unique; I would argue they are essential for any founder.

In the toughest stage of startup building—the early, pre-product-market fit (pre-PMF) phase—nimbleness in execution is crucial. At this stage, the ability to build or sell often takes priority because it's the best way to test hypotheses. Design often slows down the iteration cycle through the design tax.

Designers inherently carry a "time tax" as a trade-off for product quality. While that tax is often justified, creating an MVP frequently requires setting aside aesthetics to focus on the core user experience.

This is where obsessiveness and a high bar for taste becomes the enemy. What may seem like sloppiness to a designer is perfectly acceptable to the target user. The subconscious urge to fix things that look "off" slows down iteration.

### To the design founder

After reading this, you might get the impression that I don't believe designers should be founders, but that is simply not the case. A great designer's strengths scale with the growth of the product.

Design is a powerful differentiator that amplifies a product's potency by creating experiences users find irresistible, trustworthy, delightful, and effortless. Having a design founder with a high bar for quality and taste is extremely powerful to the eventual success of a product. However, there are traits that are simply more critical in the trenches of pre-PMF product ideation.

I believe that a design founder needs to transcend the role of a designer, let go of irrational perfectionism, and master the craft of nimble execution, whether by selling or building the barebones product. It's a path few choose to take, but those who do are rewarded with a skill set that makes them unstoppable.
