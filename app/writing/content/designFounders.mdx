A few weeks ago, I was scrolling through Twitter when I came across a tweet by Aaron Epstein, a YC group partner:

> More designers should be founders. They already have so many of the skills needed to be great—strong user empathy, a focus on solving problems, a high bar for quality, and taste. If you're a designer, what's preventing you from making the leap<SerifChar>?</SerifChar>

Before diving into what holds designers back from becoming founders, it's worth acknowledging that not everyone wants to be one. Many prioritize stability over risk, valuing a predictable job that allows them to focus on other aspects of life. But for designers, I see two key reasons for hesitation:

1. Designers are often fixated on visual beauty and perfection, which can distract from ruthless prioritization.
2. Most designers don’t have the desire to build. Early stage companies typically emphasis technical ability over design.

Creating an MVP often requires setting aside aesthetics to focus on the core user experience. Fixating on visuals at this stage becomes smoke and mirrors, pulling attention away from the most important goal: product-market fit. Will changing the container padding from 20px to 24px make the user habitually use the product<SerifChar>?</SerifChar> Probably not. What may seem like sloppiness to a designer is often perfectly acceptable to the target user.

The ability to ship fast and stay nimble is a startup’s natural edge, enabling teams to test hypotheses and quickly iterate on user feedback. I'd also argue that having some technical knowledge allows designers to reach tasteful solutions more effectively—it helps them see the full picture of a product’s potential for user delight.

Designers possess many of the skills needed to be great founders, but they often lack crucial ones that hold them back. I believe a designer-founder must transcend the role of a designer, let go of irrational perfectionism, and master the craft of nimble execution. Few choose this path, but those who do have the rare ability: to imagine and bring tasteful ideas to life. That, at the end of the day, is the crux of founding a great company.
