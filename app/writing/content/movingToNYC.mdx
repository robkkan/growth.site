A few hours ago, I handed over the biggest check of my life for my first apartment in New York City. In the moment, it felt like just another day, but deep down, I know it's a decision I'll look back on and smile.

For the past six months, I’ve been living with my parents, sporadically traveling to reset my mind. My childhood home has been a place of comfort, binging shows, and cooked meals. But it’s also been a place of complacency, where inspiration felt dull.

In just under a month, I’ll be moving into my new apartment. My childhood home symbolized comfort; NYC symbolizes joy. Cheers to good food, falling in love, taking banger photos, new inspiration, personal growth, fulfilling work, and capturing every moment and feeling.
